# Linear_Rgression_by_sklearn
This is a Machine learning project about linear regression . we all know that the linear regression algorithm is a part or example of supervised machine learning . I have done the linear regression using the headbrain.csv file from pandas .. it is done by using python programming language and JUPYTER notebook. I have used the scikitlearn for this.
